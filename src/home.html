            Reflecting on my morning stroll, a realization dawned â€” much like the diverse tapestry of nature, each
            individual possesses unique strengths and attributes. While I acknowledge a sense of feeling 'useless,'
            akin to a leaf finding its purpose in the grand scheme of a tree, the intricacies of nature's wonders have
            a way of unveiling hidden meaning. As the footer claims copyright, you may wonder why. The answer lies in
            the educational quotes, emphasizing the profound connection between the exploration of nature and personal
            insights.
        </p>

        <table>
            <caption>Individual Attributes</caption>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Stats</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Strength</td>
                    <td>55</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Speed</td>
                    <td>60</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Combat</td>
                    <td>40</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>IQ Score</td>
                    <td>80</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Work Ethic</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Jumping</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            Notably, my IQ score of 80 is not out of 100, signifying an average score. It's a reminder that everyone
            contributes their own shade to the forest of humanity, each with distinctive qualities. The categories of
            strength, speed, combat, and work ethic echo the diversity of the natural world. While my jumping skills
            may be humble, like a creature in the wild, it adds to the richness of this vast ecosystem, and also, I am a
            doctor.
